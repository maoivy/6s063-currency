            Google's currency converter has a lot of currency options—this is thorough, but a little bit difficult to use
            since there are so many of them and it's inefficient trying to find a specific one. To improve efficiency,
            I changed my app to only use the 8 most commonly-traded foreign exchange pair currencies by default.
            As a compromise to also allow some flexibility, I'm also considering adding an attribute to allow the user 
            to choose whether they want the full list of possible currencies or just the truncated list.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also like how Google lays out the result at the top of the box, making it easy to read and drawing the user's 
            attention towards the output immediately. However, I wondered if that might be a little bit too stylized for my
            component. I did decide to make my <span class="expr">output-val</span> a separate CSS part, though, to allow
            the user to stylize it if they do want to.
        </p>
        <p>
            Google's component automatically recalculates the conversion if the inputs are modified, which I am 
            considering modifying my component to do. However, the top display doesn't re-render, which I definitely
            would change in my design if I chose to do so.

            This component clearly labels each input box, which I liked, since it immediately makes it obvious how to 
            fill out the form. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the layout of the HTML structure is a little bit confusing, with the button all the way at the bottom
            and the computed result just below that. In my design, while the output isn't rendered separately, the symmetry
            between the input and output boxes (and the fact that the output value input box is disabled) at least makes 
            the component easier to visually parse.
        </p>
        <p>
            I liked the use of color to draw the user's attention towards the most important parts—the Convert button
            (which I also have in my design) and the result display. I modified my design to include CSS parts for the output 
            and design elements to allow the user to do the same.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like my design, this component also has labels for each form element, and also a Convert button 
            highlighted in a different color to draw attention to it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the design displays the form boxes in a bit of a counter-intuitive way, which makes it harder 
            to use. It shows both currency inputs first and then the value inputs, however, when we speak out loud about 
            currency conversions, we say something like "5 USD is equal to 6.37 CAD." Here, as in my design, the inputs
            come first, followed by the outputs. They are also grouped in pairs—input value and input currency, then output 
            value and output currency. There's no grouping in this design, since all the inputs are equally spaced.
            However, laying out the form according to the way people think improves the flow of data entry and means
            the user has to think less about what exactly they're supposed to enter in each box. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, the component takes a little too much space, especially vertically. If the user wants a larger component like
            this, they are able to do so by using the parts I provided; however, by default, my design is much more compact.
        </p>
